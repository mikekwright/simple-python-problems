Problem 1 - Ptyhon Functions and Variables
========================================

This is the core of all programming, the ability to store data
inside of named constructs (variables) and then being able to
have code be contained inside of an easy to use solution.

Problem
--------------------------------

In this problem you have a partial application that has been
created for you and it is looking for you to finish the pieces
that are missing. This program has the following steps:

* Create a variable that will hold the `total` of 5 numbers from the user
* Call the `get_number()` function to get a number from the user
* Add that number to the total
* Repeat those 2 steps 4 more times
* Pass the `total` to the `output_total()` function

Example
----------------------------------

```
Give me a number: 1
Give me a number: 10
Give me a number: 7
Give me a number: 5
Give me a number: 12

Total: 35
```

Try it
----------------------------------

You can run your code by opening a terminal `Ctrl+Shift+~` on windows and
running:

`python main.py`
