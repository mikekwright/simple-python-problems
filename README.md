Simple Python Problems
==========================================

These are just some simple problems that I have created for my daughter to
assist her in the learning process for working with python.  They should
not take much time, but the hope is to give her a couple of exercises
to solidify some of the core concepts of python programming.

Problems
------------------------------

* Problem 1 - Understand python functions and variables
* Problem 2 - Working with branching logic and standard input/output
* Problem 3 - Working with files and strings
* Problem 4 - Working with lists
* Problem 5 - Working with dictionaries
